\section{What is BCL?}

BCL (Basic Command Language) is a lightweight, interpreted scripting language designed to combine the power of Tcl with the readability of BASIC. It was created with the following goals in mind:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Simplicity}: Easy to learn for beginners
  \item \textbf{Portability}: Runs on both PC and embedded systems
  \item \textbf{Flexibility}: Everything is a string, making data manipulation straightforward
  \item \textbf{Expressiveness}: Tcl-inspired command structure with BASIC-style keywords
  \item \textbf{Case-insensitivity}: Commands and keywords are not case-sensitive
\end{itemize}

\begin{notebox}
BCL treats \textbf{everything as a string}. Numbers, lists, and even code are all represented as text. This simplifies the language model and makes it easy to work with data from various sources.
\end{notebox}

\section{Why BCL?}

BCL fills a unique niche in the scripting language ecosystem:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{For beginners}: The BASIC-style syntax (\cmd{IF...THEN...END}, \cmd{WHILE...DO...END}) is more intuitive than curly braces
  \item \textbf{For Tcl users}: Familiar command structure and evaluation model
  \item \textbf{For embedded systems}: Compact interpreter suitable for resource-constrained environments
  \item \textbf{For automation}: Simple file I/O, string processing, and system interaction
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation and First Steps}

\subsection{Installation}

BCL can be installed on various platforms. The standard distribution includes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The BCL interpreter executable (\file{bcl})
  \item Standard library scripts
  \item Example programs
  \item Documentation
\end{itemize}

Refer to Appendix~\ref{app:installation} for detailed installation instructions for your platform.

\subsection{Running BCL Programs}

BCL programs can be executed in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Script mode}: Run a BCL script file
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
bcl myscript.bcl
  \end{lstlisting}

  \item \textbf{Interactive mode (REPL)}: Start the BCL interpreter without arguments
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
bcl
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Your First BCL Program}

Let's start with the traditional "Hello, World!" program:

\begin{examplebox}[title=Hello World]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=BCL]
# This is a comment - my first BCL program
PUTS "Hello, World!"
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Output:}
\begin{verbatim}
Hello, World!
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Explanation:} The \cmd{PUTS} command prints text to the console followed by a newline. Text enclosed in double quotes is treated as a string literal.
\end{examplebox}

\subsection{Using the REPL}

The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is BCL's interactive mode. It's perfect for experimenting with commands and testing small code snippets.

\begin{examplebox}[title=REPL Session]
\begin{verbatim}
$ bcl
BCL> PUTS "Hello from REPL"
Hello from REPL
BCL> SET x 42
BCL> PUTS "The answer is $x"
The answer is 42
BCL> EXIT
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Explanation:} In REPL mode, you type commands and see immediate results. The \cmd{EXIT} command closes the interpreter.
\end{examplebox}

\begin{tipbox}
Use the REPL to test BCL commands while reading this manual. It's an excellent way to learn interactively!
\end{tipbox}

\section{BCL Philosophy}

Understanding BCL's core philosophy will help you write better code:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Everything is a string}: All values are text. Operations determine how strings are interpreted (as numbers, lists, etc.)

  \item \textbf{Commands return values}: Almost every BCL command returns a value that can be used by other commands

  \item \textbf{Substitution before evaluation}: Variable values (using \$) and command results (using []) are substituted before the command executes

  \item \textbf{Blocks end with END}: Control structures use explicit \cmd{END} keywords instead of braces or indentation

  \item \textbf{Case-insensitive}: \cmd{PUTS}, \cmd{puts}, and \cmd{Puts} are all the same command
\end{enumerate}
